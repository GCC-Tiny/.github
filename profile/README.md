## Step by step guide creating GCC frontend parsers

Originally by Roger Ferrer Ibáñez.

[Step-By-Step Tiny Frontend](http://gcc-tiny-docs-rtd.readthedocs.io/) updated by the GCC Tiny Project.

The original, unedited blog posts are [here](https://thinkingeek.com/gcc-tiny/).

The guide starts with a fresh clone of GCC and describes all the necessary steps to create a functioning compiler.

Take a look at the [Source code for the Tiny GCC Frontend](https://github.com/GCC-Tiny/gcc/tree/src-gcc-tiny/gcc/tiny)
